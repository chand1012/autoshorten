# Autoshorten

A simple application that reads your clipboard, and if a link is found, shortens it.

# Installation

First, download a binary either from the [releases](https://tinyurl.com/y438kjf3) page or download a development version from the latest [CI build](https://tinyurl.com/yypfhv78). For the releases, only download the binary for your appropriate platform. For development builds, all the binaries are in one ZIP file. If you are on Windows and are unsure whether you need the x86_64 version or the x86 version, download the x86 version.

## Windows

After downloading the appropriate binary, move the file to a directory where you have write privileges. I recommend a folder in your documents, such as `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Autoshorten`. After this is complete, right-click on the binary and press `Create Shortcut`.

Copy the shortcut. Press the `Windows+R` keys at the same time to open up the run dialog. Then type in `shell:startup` and press `Ok`.

This will bring you to your startup folder. Paste the shortcut in and then restart your computer.

Your installation is complete! You should see the little blue icon of a chain link in your TaskBar.

In the future I plan on adding an installer for Windows, but for now this is the only option to install. 

## Linux

<sub> These will be more detailed in the future.</sub>

Download the executable, copy to a folder where you have write privileges, add to your startup programs via your favorite desktop environment.
